# EcoSeaEO-BalticSea-TRIX-BlueCloud
EcoSea EO is a cloud-based monitoring system that overlaps Wastewater Treatment Plant-WWTP discharges with near-real-time eutrophication indicators in the Baltic Sea. Using the Copernicus Marine Service API and Blue Cloud Vlabs data, the TRIX indicator is automatically calculated from chlorophyll, dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen layers.
